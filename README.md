# Java OOP Practice

Daily Java OOP interview-oriented practice.
Focus: clean code, constructors, methods, collections.

Day 1:
- Class & Object
- Constructor overloading
- Business logic
- State handling
- Aggregation

 Day 2: Encapsulation
- Getters and setters
- Validation inside setters
- Read-only fields
- Controlled update methods
- Immutable class design
- Defensive setters
- State safety

Day 3: Inheritance & Polymorphism
- Inheritance using `extends`
- Constructor chaining with `super`
- Method overriding
- Overriding vs overloading
- Runtime polymorphism
- Parent reference → child object
- `final` methods in inheritance
- Dynamic method dispatch

 Day 4: Abstraction
- Abstract classes
- Abstract methods
- Partial abstraction
- Abstract class constructors
- Runtime polymorphism with abstract references
- Abstract vs concrete method control
- Template Method pattern (intro)
